This Web App uses Ruby on Rails and NASA's API for Mars Rover Images to help display
Mars Rover Images.

The user will enter the Sol(standard mars day) and rails will display the first 25 images
that was took on that day, along with the name of the camera that took it, and the earth date
it was taken on.

The coding in ruby at this stage is very primitive and any advice on how to improve would
be appreciated.
